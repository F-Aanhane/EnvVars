# Questions
  a. What is the response from the data request?
  b. Take a look at mock_api.credential_store.py. The username/passwords are encoded, why would an API do that?
  c. Here is publicly available encoding method used. Why would that in real-life situation be unwise?
  d. What encoding is used? Look in mock_api.functions.py for hints
